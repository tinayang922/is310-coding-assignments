# Fandom Wikis and Web Scraping Homework
In this assignment, we are welcome to select any fandom wiki we are 
interested in and the goal is try scraping the wiki. 

## fandom wiki: Super Mario Wiki
I am going to scrape Super Mario Wiki. (https://www.mariowiki.com/) 
This Wiki offers extensive information on Nintendo's gaming franchises, which are 
popular among both researchers and Mario fans. This wiki contains rich data 
about characters, games, items, and other elements that can be used for 
studying the evolution of video game design, the cultural impact of 
characters, and trends in game mechanics.I am particularly interested in scraping data related 
to Super Mario Games. (https://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_games) The information in
this game list will be useful for researchers studying 
trends in Mario game development and the role of specific characters in popular 
culture over time. 

## What you will need to run the fandom_wiki_scraping.py file:
- Python with pandas, beautifulsoup, requests, and csv installed
- Stable internet to scrape the webpage

## Check the terms of service or user policies of the website
I checked the `robots.txt` file (https://www.mariowiki.com/robots.txt).
